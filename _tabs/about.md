### Hi there üëã

I'm a computational Senior Scientific Officer at the Institute of Cancer Research
working at the interface of digital pathology, spatial multiomics, and clinical data.

Interested in explaining the complex biological processes driving cancer
by leveraging these multiple high-dimensional data modalities, I seek to develop
impactful software solutions to empower researchers and colleagues.
