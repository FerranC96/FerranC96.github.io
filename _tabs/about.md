## Short Biography

With a background in molecular biotechnology, Ferran transitioned into computational 
roles for his MSc in Bioinformatics at Imperial College London. 
Having developed a passion for single-cell omic analysis, he then moved to 
University College London where he earned a PhD in Computational Biology focused 
on understanding colorectal cancer and its microenvironment.

Ferran has published significant work on the analysis of single-cell omic datasets
and the biology of colorectal cancer. 
Furthermore, he has developed and published multiple computational tools; 
including a tool for visualising data-driven Waddington-like cellular landscapes
that became the cover of a 2023 *Cell* issue.

As a Senior Scientific Officer and Bioinformatician in the IPU, Ferran is 
working at the interface of digital pathology, spatial multiomics, and clinical data. 
His work aims to enhance our understanding of cancer mechanisms and 
inform downstream integrated diagnostics, including through the development of 
open software solutions to empower other researchers.
