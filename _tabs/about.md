### Hi there 👋

I'm a last year PhD Student in Computational Biology working with single-cell omics data at the [Tape Lab](http://tape-lab.com/).
Interested in looking into cancer, plasticity and how the tumour micro-environment and genetic alterations interact to control these processes.
Always eager to learn new things!

⚡  About Me: I love both nature🌿 and tech👨‍💻, and will rarely refuse going out for a pint🍻!

❣️  Check Her Out: My fiancée is a researcher that loves drawing on her spare time. Check out the amazing things she's done as [Aquacletas here](https://aquacletas.github.io/)!
