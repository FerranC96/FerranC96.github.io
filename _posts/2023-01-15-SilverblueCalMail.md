Calendar, mail and exchange config for later reference.

### Email Setup for Thunderbird:

Setting up email in Thunderbird can sometimes be challenging, especially when dealing with Eliapps and making the outgoing server work.

### Calendar Setup:

When it comes to Microsoft Exchange, integrating the calendar functionality can be a bit tricky. One workaround is to add the calendars to the Google platform using the "publish outlook function" and then importing the URL (.ics) into Google Calendar.

Please note that while this method works on the web, it may not sync with the general Gnome online account system. Even if it works on Android, it might still fail to sync with the Gnome online accounts even after removing and re-adding the account.
There is a way to force it to sync the published calendar but I didn't have any luck with it...



### Alternative Approach:

If setting up calendars via IMAP in Thunderbird proves to be problematic, an alternative option is to obtain the URL (.ics) and add it as an internet calendar.

The same approach can be followed for adding the Eliapps calendar as well (for the Yale account).
