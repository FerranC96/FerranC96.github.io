This is a stub entry discussing my experience at this year's [Graph Signal Processing workshop](http://gspworkshop.org/) in Oxford.

I attended together with collaborators Aarthi Venkat and Prof. Smita Krishnaswamy, where we presented work re. learning embeddings of directed gene-gene networks.
We also had lots of fun, including of course a formal dinner at an Oxford's college and even afternoon tea!
