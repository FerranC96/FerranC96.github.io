This is a stub entry discussing my experience at this year's [Graph Signal Processing workshop](http://gspworkshop.org/) in Oxford.

I attended together with collaborators Aarthi Venkat and Prof. Smita Krishnaswamy, where we brought work on learning embeddings of directed gene-gene networks.
Aarthi presented the work as an amazing talk during the second day!
And of course, we also had lots of fun; including a formal dinner at an Oxford's college, some afternoon tea!
