This is a stub entry for some of my work helping a collaborator sequence and run some Oxford Nanopore data.

The entry will include work troubleshooting a MinION Mk1C device, and exploring the nextflow-based EPI2ME pipelines provided by Oxford Nanopore (specifically in the context of running them in Docker, Podman and singularity containers).
