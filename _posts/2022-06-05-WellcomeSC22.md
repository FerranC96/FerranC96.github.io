## Introduction (1/10 & 2/10)

### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Cues as Cell Fate Regulators

It is understood that both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are crucial in determining cell fate.
- As Intrinsic cues we might have mutations, a cell’s epigenetic state, and transcriptional networks.
- As for extrinsic cues, we might have mechanobiological signals, metabolites or growth factors.

Now, in a cancerous cell we know that intrinsic cues such as oncogenic mutations are key when controlling cell fate, but so are the extrinsic cues coming from the tumour microenvironment.

Here at the tape lab and in this project in particular are interested in understanding how do oncogenes and the TME regulate cell fate in the context of Colorectal Cancer.

### Single-cell Technologies to Study CRC Organoids

CRC is a very common cancer, claiming 800 thousand worldwide deaths per year
Much like other cancers it presents as a collection of malignant and 
non-transformed cells, resulting in a complex heterocellular setting where 
colonic epithelia closely interacts with the surrounding tumour microenvironment, 
consisting among others of stromal fibroblasts and myeloid macrophages.
In fact, TME is key factor in CRC, with increased stromal and myeloid components 
correlating with worse prognosis.

In order to study this disease we model it using organoids, self assembling 3D 
structures that we can grow *in vitro* in Heterocellular settings that can mimic 
the TME. 

Such a heterogenous system requires of single-cell technologies to be properly
characterised.
Mass cytometry is easily scalable and ideal to study intra-cellular 
communications via PTMs. 
On the other hand, scrnaseq can be used to describe inter-cellular 
communication by looking at the expression of ligands and receptors between cells.


## Experimental setup and methods (3/10)

### Multivariate scRNA-seq of CRC-TME Organoids

To explore how intrinsic oncogenes and extrinsic stromal cues regulate 
colonic epithelial fate we performed a multivariate scRNA-seq analysis of organoids.

In it we had organoids ranging from WT to those progressively harbouring 
mutational hallmarks of CRC, either in a monoculture or co-cultured with 
colonic fibroblasts and/or macrophages. Furthermore we also included a WT 
monoculture grown with exogenous WNT3A, EGF, Nogging and R-spondin1 as a 
niche factor control.

Analysed using scrnaseq we were able to identify the three cell types in the system.
We then focused on the epithelial compartment, with the main steps of the 
analysis shown here;  including velocity, differential abundance, and 
cell-cell communication analysis.


## Results (4/10 - 9/10)

### scRNA-seq Captures Colonic Epithelia Differentiation

Now with a subset of just of the epithelial cells from the system 
(around 30k cells across 17 conditions), we were able to capture colonic 
epithelia differentiation.
We identified clusters associated with the main colonic epithelia cell types;  
including a stem, secretory and absortive populations.

The overall dynamics of the system were also recovered, with SCENT’s CCAT 
entropy based metric indicating greater pluripotency estimates for the 
colonic stem cell clusters, as well as RNA velocity stream embeddings going 
towards the differentiated states.
Now, it is important to note that instead of a monolithic colonic stem cells
population, we identified a heterogenous compartment with multiple states

### Oncogenes and Fibroblasts Differentially Regulate CSC

We then investigated when these multiple colonic stem cell states were being 
regulated using differential abundance analysis. 
Comparing our control WT monocultures with CRC organoids we saw a significant 
enrichment of cellular neighbourhoods associated with the proliferative 
Colonic stem cell population, shown in this phate embedding in red. 
Note also how the more differentiated late enterocyte cells are on the other 
hand being lost.

On the other hand, we noticed how the addition of fibroblasts in the coculture 
induced a clear enrichment of the revival CSC in the WT organoids.

These 2 distinct and differentially regulated CSC populations where 
characterised using Differential Expression. 

As shown in this curated heatmap, proCSC are characterised by being 
particularly hyperproliferative and expressing Lgr5 and Birc5.
RevCSC are quite distinct from the other colonic stem cells, being less 
proliferative and expressing clustering; their unique transcriptional signature 
matching that of the revival stem cell population in the intestine.

Interestingly, while the CSC and proCSC clusters consist mostly of AK and AKP 
cells , the revCSC cluster is dominated by WT cells.

### Oncogenic Entrapment of the Colon Epithelia 

That is because it appears that the oncogenic mutations are trapping the 
colonic epithelia in an oncogenic state.

First we have a summary of cluster abundance changes across all conditions.
It clearly shows how the first 2 colonic stem cell clusters are being 
upregulated by the oncogenes, and how the revCSC are being induced in WT and ApcKD fibroblast cocultures.

HOWEVER, there’s a clear loss of fibroblast regulation in AK and AKP organoids. 
Furthermore it seems like WENR is inducing all CSC states in wt organoids.

We also used RNA velocity lengths to compare differentiation rates across 
organoids. 
We compared side-by-side our WT controls, WT+fibroblast cocultures, AK 
organoids and the WENR enriched condition, 

As you can see here the AK organoids showed the lowest velocity lengths 
(which was consistent with AKP organoids too).

To explore the mechanisms behind this oncogenic entrapment we used cell-cell 
communication analysis of the fibroblast cocultures across the different 
genotypes.
With these plots we can compare the quantity of incoming and outgoing signals 
as detected by cellchat, with the arrows showing aggregate interaction 
strengths from the fibroblasts to the epithelia clusters.

As we had expected, the fibroblasts appear to be predominantly characterised 
by outgoing signalling consistently across all genotypes.
However, while the WT epithelia shows a high score for incoming signals it 
quickly dropped following the accumulation of oncogenic mutations.

These results suggest that oncogenic mutations erode fibroblast to epithelia 
communication, with the CRC organoids acting as “bad listeners”.

### Exogenous Ligands Model CSC Regulation

Now if you remember we had seen that WENR promoted all CSC states, so to 
explore how exogenous ligands model CSC regulation we used mass cytometry to 
analyse organoid monocultures across 60 different conditions with different 
genotypes and ligands.
 
In this condition-based phate embedding we can see how:
STEP-> we can recapitulate the revCSC cells characterised by clusterin 
expression. These cells seem to be associated with exogenous wnt3a and low 
MAPK and b-cat signalling.
STEP-> We can also see the Birc5 positive proCSC , which were characterised 
by high MAPK and b-cat signalling.

Now using a Scaffold map centred around key genotypes we can see how oncogenes
and the exogenous ligands navigate a shared regulatory landscape. 
If for example, we take a WT organoid and add exogenous WNT3A we will be 
promoting the revCSC. 
On the other hand, if we take an organoid with just oncogenic Kras (not 
sufficient on its own to trap the epithelia in a proCSC-like state) and add 
r-spondin we shift cell fate towards the proCSC.


## Summary (10/10)

We have identified 2 distinct and differentially regulated CSC states:
Intrinsic oncogenic cues seem to induce a hyper proliferative CSC population
Whereas extrinsic stromal cues induce the revCSCs

Oncogenic mutations are trapping the colonic epithelia in the 
hyperproliferative state.
This seems to be due to the erosion of stromal regulation in CRC organoids.
And is also suggested by the lowered differentiation rates in them 

Finally, it appears that both intrinsic and extrinsic cues navigate a 
shared regulatory landscape
Regulated by EGF and WNT signalling, up to the point until APC loss and 
oncogenic KRAS trap the organoids, turning them refractory towards the 
external cues
