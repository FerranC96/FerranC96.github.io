Situated just 12km to the north of the city of London, Walthamstow Wetlands extend for more than 2km and is one of the largest urban wetland nature reserves in Europe, where wildlife and industrialism meet.

These wetlands were founded and built between 1863 and 1904, providing drinking water to the rapidly growing population of London. In 1894, the Engine House was built and remained in service until the 1980s. Underneath the building was a network of underground reservoirs, chambers and pipes that linked the reservoirs. Now, these reservoirs support the most notable variety of breeding wetland birds among all of London's drinking water reservoirs.

Easy to reach thanks to Victoria Line, these wetlands are the perfect place to expend a nice morning exploring nature, looking for birds, or even fishing! Alternatively, you can choose to do a guided tour through these wetlands, learning more about its biosphere and importance.

As you can see in the video, we decided to get there with our electric scooters and drive through Lea river, running just next to the wetlands. If you go, make sure to visit the top of the copper mill and admire the views of Alexandra Palace and the City of London :)
