The aim of this post is to improve the accessibility of the talk given at the 
**[Cancer Institute 2022 conference](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/single-cell-biology-20220606/)** 
as part of the *Recent Discoveries* series.

This is an improved iteration of the talk given one month earlier at the 
**[Wellcome Single Cell Conference 2022]({% post_url 2022-06-05-WellcomeSC22 %})**. 
See the talk slides and transcript notes in that entry.
