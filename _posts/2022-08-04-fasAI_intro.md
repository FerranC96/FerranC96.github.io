Just before going on a 3 month long exchange at Yale University, 
as part of the UCL-Yale Exchange programme, I decided to start 2022's edition 
of the FastAI course.

I followed the course mostly in an asynchronous manner, and will finish it at 
some point in 2023 when I will update this blog post entry with some interesting 
results, highlights of what I learned and my overall impressions on it.
